# Why have this policy?

When groups of people come together, there can be disagreement or conflict. Unfortunately, sometimes that crosses the line into insensitive and inappropriate words or actions, ultimately creating a toxic environment that’s not as inclusive and healthy as it should be. It’s our job, as shepherds and developers of a community, to set a good example, and to take clear action against bad behavior.

If you’re thinking, “that’s NEVER an issue in MY chapter,” then great. But it only takes one incident to turn a meeting from comfortable to awkward, so it’s good to be prepared to manage such a situation if it should ever arise. That’s why we’re providing this “anti-harassment policy” document for you to use at your discretion in your chapter. Also included are instructions for event staff on how to enforce this policy.

### How to use it?
Please consider this policy text as a template, and you may want to start a conversation about it with active members to create text that works for your community. We suggest linking the document on your chapter’s home page, as well as including it in individual event/meetup registration sites.

We have also provided a shorter, “Don’t be a jerk” policy that is a more casual version of the longer policy. This blurb may be used in lieu of the longer policy, or possibly linked to it. We are providing this blurb as an additional language option you can use to communicate this policy to your group and event attendees.

Ultimately, it is up to you how you’d like to communicate and use the anti-harassment policy.

# Anti-Harassment Policy

Why do we have an official anti-harassment policy for GDG São Paulo events?

- It sets expectations for behavior at the event. Simply having an anti-harassment policy can prevent harassment.
- It encourages people to attend who have had bad experiences at other events.
- It gives event staff/volunteers instructions on how to handle harassment quickly, with the minimum amount of disruption for the event.

GDG São Paulo is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of:

- gender
- sexual orientation
- disability
- gender identity
- age
- race
- religion
- nationality

The above is not an exhaustive list -- we do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks. Event participants violating these rules may be expelled from the event, and even banned from future events at the discretion of the event organizers/management.

Harassment includes (but is not limited to):
- offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion
- the use or display of sexual images in public spaces
- deliberate intimidation
- stalking
- harassing photography or recording
- sustained disruption of talks or other events
- inappropriate physical contact
- unwelcome sexual attention

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibiting partners and guest speakers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors and speakers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material, or otherwise create a sexualized environment in their slide decks, exhibit material, exhibit staffing, promotional items or demo material.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer or event volunteer immediately. Organizers and event volunteers may be identified by t-shirts or special badges/lanyards. Organizers will investigate the issue and take appropriate action. This may include helping participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.

Though we hope that we never have to invoke this policy, we believe that having this document helps everyone think a little more about how their actions and words affect the whole community, as well as individuals in the community.
